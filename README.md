# cSharpPractice
Code Repository of various code snippets created while learning and exploring.

You won't find anything too interesting here; this repo is being used as a means to store active projects so I can use them from different computers and different locations.

NOTE: Some portions of the code stored in this repo are derived from the following books:

"Pro C# 7 with .NET and .NET Core" by Andrew Troelsen and Philip Japikse, published by Apress, copyright 2017, preserving certain rights to the publisher. For detailed information about source code published in this book, see www.apress.com/source-code, or the book's GitHub product page www.apress.com/9781484230176

"Essential Algorithms" by Rod Stephens, puiblished by Wiley, copyright 2013, and the publisher hold rights to the material and its reproduction. Although the book contains primarily pseudo-code of algorithms that are known and regularly utilized in software development, my intention is to preserve my work while thumbing through the text, not to reproduce nor redistribute in any way.
