Code Repository of various code snippets created while learning and exploring.

You won't find anything too interesting here; this repo is being used as a means to store active projects so I can use them from different computers and different locations.

NOTE: Some portions of the code stored in this repo are derived from the book "Pro C# 7 with .NET and .NET Core" by Andrew Troelsen and Philip Japikse, published by Apress, which includes a 2017 copyright, preserving certain rights to the publisher.
